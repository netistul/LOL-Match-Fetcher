# LOL-Match-Fetcher
LoL Match Fetcher retrieves and caches League of Legends match data and team logos from the AllSportsAPI, optimizing data fetching. It utilizes Azure Blob Storage for logo management, ensuring efficient and organized data handling for further analysis or display purposes. ðŸ¦‰

## Frontend
The frontend for this project is a Chrome extension that reads the match data from the JSON file generated by the backend. It is hosted in a separate repository: [LoL-Esports-Chrome-Extension](https://github.com/netistul/LoL-Esports-Chrome-Extension).
